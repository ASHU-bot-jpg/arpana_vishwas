    text: "To all the teachers at iCreative Learning: Thank you for providing such wonderful learning experience for Reyansh. It's been 3 years now since he joined iCreative Learning programs and we have noticed a lot of improvements in his skill set, earlier at Math and now in Language Art. He has grown more confident in problem solving and tackling challenges. One specific example that stands out is he has started doing his school homework and the research related to it independently which wasn't the case earlier :) We do help sometimes but there is a significant change in him! We appreciate the dedication and effort you all put in and we look forward to seeing Reyansh continue to grow.",

    text: "We've had a wonderful experience with your program! Shaunak has shown great improvement in writing and comprehension, thanks to Ms. Haripriya and Ms. Arpana for an accommodating approach and personalized guidance. He's become more focused, taking the time to read carefully instead of rushing to answers. His confidence has also grownâ€”he was especially proud when he wrote more words than his classmates! Thank you for making learning such a positive and enriching experience.",
