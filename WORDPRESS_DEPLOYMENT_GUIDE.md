## üîß **Technical Requirements**

### **WordPress Hosting Requirements:**

## üìß **Update WooCommerce Links**

Before going live, update these placeholder URLs in your code:

**Current placeholder:**

```

**Replace with your actual WooCommerce URL:**
```
https://yourdomain.com/shop/checkout
```

## üéØ **Recommended Approach**

For your situation, I recommend **Option 1 (Direct Static Site)** because:

1. **Immediate deployment** - Works instantly
2. **Best performance** - Fastest loading times
3. **No maintenance** - No WordPress updates needed
4. **Exact design match** - Your current design preserved perfectly

### **For Future Editing:**
- Use a headless CMS like Contentful or Strapi
- Or rebuild with WordPress later when needed
- Content updates can be done by rebuilding and uploading

## üÜò **Need Help?**

### **Common Issues:**
1. **404 errors:** Check if `.htaccess` file is uploaded
2. **Blank page:** Check if all `assets/` files are uploaded
3. **Styles missing:** Verify CSS file path in `assets/` folder

### **Testing Checklist:**

## üîÑ **Rollback Plan**
