## 🚨 **If Links Are Still Broken, Try These Steps:**

### **Step 1: Clear Browser Cache**

1. **Hard Refresh**: Press `Ctrl+F5` (Windows) or `Cmd+Shift+R` (Mac)
2. **Clear Cache**:
   - Chrome: F12 → Network tab → Check "Disable cache"
   - Or open DevTools → Right-click refresh → "Empty Cache and Hard Reload"

### **Step 2: Check if URLs Load Directly**

Test these URLs directly in your browser:

- `https://icreativelearning.com/shop/`
- `https://icreativelearning.com/registeration/`

**If these give 404 errors**, the WordPress pages don't exist yet.

### **Step 3: Browser DevTools Inspection**

1. **Right-click** on a "Pay Fees" button
2. **Inspect Element**
3. **Check if it shows**: `<a href="https://icreativelearning.com/shop/">`
4. **If it shows** `<div href="...">` then there's a React rendering issue

### **Step 4: Console Errors**

1. **Open DevTools** (F12)
2. **Go to Console tab**
3. **Look for any red errors** that might prevent proper rendering

## 🔄 **Alternative Solution: Use Static Pages**

If the WordPress URLs are still not working, we can use the static HTML pages we created:

### **For Pay Fees:**

```
https://yoursite.netlify.app/cart/
```

### **For Registration:**

```
https://yoursite.netlify.app/registeration/
```

These static pages will work immediately and provide the same functionality.

---

## 🛠️ **Quick Fix Options:**

### **Option 1: Update to Static Pages**

Change all URLs to use your Netlify static pages instead of WordPress:

- Pay Fees: `/cart/` (internal link)
- Registration: `/registeration/` (internal link)

### **Option 2: Fix WordPress Pages**

1. **Create the missing WordPress pages**:
   - `/shop/` page on your WordPress site
   - `/registeration/` page on your WordPress site
2. **Test URLs directly** before using in the app

### **Option 3: Use Different WordPress URLs**

If those specific URLs don't work, let me know what URLs DO work on your WordPress site and I'll update all the buttons.

## 🔍 **Debugging Questions:**

1. **Do these URLs work when you visit them directly?**
   - `https://icreativelearning.com/shop/`
   - `https://icreativelearning.com/registeration/`

2. **What error do you see when clicking the buttons?**
   - 404 Page Not Found?
   - Page loads but wrong content?
   - Nothing happens?

3. **Are you testing on the deployed Netlify site or local development?**

Let me know the answers and I can provide a targeted fix!
